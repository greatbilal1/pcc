# Chapter 2: Numbers and Variables

This chapter covers working with numbers and variables in Python. It covers the following topics:

- Different types of numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers)
- Basic mathematical operations
- Variables and data types
- Using variables to store and manipulate data
- Type casting

Examples are provided throughout the chapter to help you understand and apply the concepts covered. By the end of the chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with numbers and variables in Python and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

## Summary
In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. You learned to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise. You learned what strings are and how to display them using low-ercase, uppercase, and title case. You started using whitespace to organize output neatly, and you learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string. You started working with integers and floats, and you learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data. You also learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read. Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, whenever possible.In Chapter 3, you’ll learn how to store collections of information in data structures called lists. You’ll also learn how to work through a list, manipulating any information in that list.
